## SDK Configuration

This guide addresses v2 of the SDK configuration format. You can determine which version you are using by evaluating the constant prepended to the returned array in your application's `config/auth0.php` file, prefixed with `Configuration::VERSION_`. For example:

```php
return Configuration::VERSION_2 + [
  // ...
];
```

If you do not see such a value, you are most likely using an outdated configuration format, and should upgrade by running `php artisan vendor:publish --tag auth0 --force` from your project directory. You will lose any alterations you have made to this file in the process.

### JSON Configuration Files

The preferred method of SDK configuration is to use JSON exported from the [Auth0 CLI](https://auth0.com/docs/cli). This allows you to use the CLI to manage your Auth0 configuration, and then export the configuration to JSON for use by the SDK.

The SDK will look for the following files in the project directory, in the order listed:

- `auth0.json`
- `auth0.<APP_ENV>.json`
- `auth0.api.json`
- `auth0.app.json`
- `auth0.api.<APP_ENV>.json`
- `auth0.app.<APP_ENV>.json`

Where `<APP_ENV>` is the value of Laravel's `APP_ENV` environment variable (if set.) Duplicate keys in the files listed above will be overwritten in the order listed.

### Environment Variables

The SDK also supports configuration using environment variables. These can be defined within the host environment, or using so-called dotenv (`.env`, or `.env.*`) files in the project directory.

| Variable              | Description                                                                                          |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

### Order of Priority

The SDK collects configuration data from multiple potential sources, in the following order:

- `.auth0.json` files
- `.env` (dotenv) files
- Host environment variables

> **Note:**  
> In the filenames listed below, `%APP_ENV%` is replaced by the application's configured `APP_ENV` environment variable, if one is set.

It begins by loading matching JSON configuration files from the project's root directory, in the following order:

- `.auth0.json`
- `.auth0.%APP_ENV%.json`
- `.auth0.api.json`
- `.auth0.app.json`
- `.auth0.api.%APP_ENV%.json`
- `.auth0.app.%APP_ENV%.json`

It then loads configuration data from available `.env` (dotenv) configuration files, in the following order.

- `.env`
- `.env.auth0`
- `.env.%APP_ENV%`
- `.env.%APP_ENV%.auth0`

Finally, it loads environment variables from the host environment.

Duplicate configuration data is overwritten by the value from the last source loaded. For example, if the `AUTH0_DOMAIN` environment variable is set in both the `.env` file and the host environment, the value from the host environment will be used.

Although JSON configuration keys are different from their associated environment variable counterparts, these are translated automatically by the SDK. For example, the `domain` key in the JSON configuration files is translated to the `AUTH0_DOMAIN` environment variable.

### Default Behavior

#### Guard Registration

By default, the SDK will register the Authentication and Authorization guards with your Laravel application, as well as a compatible [User Provider](./Users.md).

You can disable this behavior by setting `registerGuards` to `false` in your `config/auth0.php` file.

```php
return Configuration::VERSION_2 + [
  'registerGuards' => false,
  // ...
];
```

To register the guards manually, update the arrays in your `config/auth.php` file to include the following additions:

```php
'guards' => [
  'auth0-session' => [
    'driver' => 'auth0.authenticator',
    'provider' => 'auth0-provider',
    'configuration' => 'web',
  ],
  'auth0-api' => [
    'driver' => 'auth0.authorizer',
    'provider' => 'auth0-provider',
    'configuration' => 'api',
  ],
],

'providers' => [
  'auth0-provider' => [
    'driver' => 'auth0.provider',
    'repository' => 'auth0.repository',
  ],
],
```

#### Middleware Registration

By default, the SDK will register the Authentication and Authorization guards within your application's `web` and `api` middleware groups.

You can disable this behavior by setting `registerMiddleware` to `false` in your `config/auth0.php` file.

```php
return Configuration::VERSION_2 + [
  'registerMiddleware' => false,
  // ...
];
```

To register the middleware manually, update your `app/Http/Kernel.php` file and include the following additions:

```php
protected $middlewareGroups = [
  'web' => [
    \Auth0\Laravel\Middleware\AuthenticatorMiddleware::class,
    // ...
  ],

  'api' => [
    \Auth0\Laravel\Middleware\AuthorizerMiddleware::class,
    // ...
  ],
];
```

Alternatively, you can assign the guards to specific routes by using the `Auth` facade. For `routes/web.php`, add the following before any routes:

```php
Auth::shouldUse('auth0-session');
```

For `routes/api.php`, add the following before any routes:

```php
Auth::shouldUse('auth0-api');
```

#### Route Registration

By default, the SDK will register the following routes for authentication:

| Method | URI         | Name       | Controller                                     | Purpose                            |
| ------ | ----------- | ---------- | ---------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| `GET`  | `/login`    | `login`    | `Auth0\Laravel\Controllers\LoginController`    | Initiates the authentication flow. |
| `GET`  | `/logout`   | `logout`   | `Auth0\Laravel\Controllers\LogoutController`   | Logs the user out.                 |
| `GET`  | `/callback` | `callback` | `Auth0\Laravel\Controllers\CallbackController` | Handles the callback from Auth0.   |

You can disable this behavior by setting `registerAuthenticationRoutes` to `false` in your `config/auth0.php` file.

```php
return Configuration::VERSION_2 + [
  'registerAuthenticationRoutes' => false,
  // ...
];
```

If you've disabled the automatic registration of routes, you must register the routes manually for authentication to work.

```php
use Auth0\Laravel\Controllers\{LoginController, LogoutController, CallbackController};

Route::group(['middleware' => ['guard:auth0-session']], static function (): void {
  Route::get('/login', LoginController::class)->name('login');
  Route::get('/logout', LogoutController::class)->name('logout');
  Route::get('/callback', CallbackController::class)->name('callback');
});
```

Or you can call the SDK Facade's `routes()` method in your `routes/web.php` file:

```php
Auth0::routes();
```

- These must be registered within the `web` middleware group, as they rely on sessions.
- Requests must be routed through the SDK's Authenticator guard.

## Auth0 Configuration

The following guidance is provided to help you configure your Auth0 tenant for use with the SDK. It is not intended to be a comprehensive guide to configuring Auth0. Please refer to the [Auth0 documentation](https://auth0.com/docs) for more information.

### Auth0 Applications

#### Creating Applications with the CLI

Use the CLI's `apps create` command to create a new Auth0 Application:

```shell
auth0 apps create \
  --name "My Laravel Application" \
  --type "regular" \
  --auth-method "post" \
  --callbacks "http://localhost:8000/callback" \
  --logout-urls "http://localhost:8000" \
  --reveal-secrets \
  --no-input
```

If you are configuring the SDK for this application, make note of the `client_id` and `client_secret` values returned by the command. Follow the guidance in the [configuration guide](#configuration) to configure the SDK using these values.

The following parameters used in this example are of note:

- `--type` - The [application type](https://auth0.com/docs/get-started/applications).
  - For Laravel applications, this should always be set to `regular`.
- `--auth-method` - This represents the 'Token Endpoint Authentication Method' used for authentication.
  - For Laravel applications, this should always be set to `post`.
- `--callbacks` - The callback URLs to use for authentication.
  - In development, this should be set to `http://localhost:8000/callback` or as appropriate.
  - In production, adjust this value to match your application's Internet-accessible URL for its`/callback`` route.
  - This value can be a comma-separated list of URLs.
- `--logout-urls` - The logout URLs to use for authentication.
  - In development, this should be set to `http://localhost:8000` or as appropriate.
  - In production, adjust this value to match where your application redirects end users after logging out. The value should be an Internet-accessible URL.
  - This value can be a comma-separated list of URLs.

Please refer to the [CLI documentation](https://auth0.github.io/auth0-cli/auth0_apps_create.html) for additional information on the `apps create` command.

#### Modifying Applications using the CLI

Use the CLI's `apps update` command to create a new Auth0 API:

```shell
auth0 apps update %CLIENT_ID% \
  --name "My Updated Laravel Application" \
  --callbacks "https://production/callback,http://localhost:8000/callback" \
  --logout-urls "https://production/logout,http://localhost:8000" \
  --no-input
```

Substitute `%CLIENT_ID%` with your application's Client ID. Depending on how you configured the SDK, this value can be found:

- In the `.auth0.app.json` file in your project's root directory, as the `client_id` property value.
- In the `.env` file in your project's root directory, as the `AUTH0_CLIENT_ID` property value.
- As the `AUTH0_CLIENT_ID` environment variable.
- Evaluating the output from the CLI's `apps list` command.

Please refer to the [CLI documentation](https://auth0.github.io/auth0-cli/auth0_apps_update.html) for additional information on the `apps update` command.

### Auth0 APIs

#### Creating APIs with the CLI

Use the CLI's `apis create` command to create a new Auth0 API:

```shell
auth0 apis create \
  --name "My Laravel Application API" \
  --identifier "https://github.com/auth0/laravel-auth0" \
  --offline-access \
  --no-input
```

If you are configuring the SDK for this API, make note of the `identifier` you used here. Follow the guidance in the [configuration guide](#configuration) to configure the SDK using this value.

The following parameters are of note:

- `--identifier` - The [unique identifier](https://auth0.com/docs/get-started/apis/api-settings#general-settings) for your API, sometimes referred to as the `audience`. This can be any value you wish, but it must be unique within your account. It cannot be changed later.
- `--offline-access` - This enables the use of [Refresh Tokens](https://auth0.com/docs/tokens/refresh-tokens) for your API. This is not required for the SDK to function.

Please refer to the [CLI documentation](https://auth0.github.io/auth0-cli/auth0_apis_create.html) for additional information on the `apis create` command.

#### Modifying APIs using the CLI

Use the CLI's `apis update` command to create a new Auth0 API:

```shell
auth0 apis update %IDENTIFIER% \
  --name "My Updated Laravel Application API" \
  --token-lifetime 6100 \
  --offline-access=false \
  --scopes "letter:write,letter:read" \
  --no-input
```

Substitute `%IDENTIFIER%` with your API's unique identifier.

Please refer to the [CLI documentation](https://auth0.github.io/auth0-cli/auth0_apis_update.html) for additional information on the `apis update` command.
