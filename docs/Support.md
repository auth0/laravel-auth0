# Support

To integrate our SDK, your application must use a [supported Laravel version](https://laravelversions.com/en), and your environment must run a [supported PHP version](https://www.php.net/supported-versions.php). We do not support versions of either that are no longer supported by their maintainers.

| SDK  | Laravel | PHP  | Supported Until |
| ---- | ------- | ---- | --------------- |
| 7.5+ | 10      | 8.2+ | Feb 2025        |
|      |         | 8.1+ | Nov 2024        |
| 7.0+ | 9       | 8.2+ | Feb 2024        |
|      |         | 8.1+ | Feb 2024        |
|      |         | 8.0+ | Nov 2023        |

You will also need [Composer 2.0+](https://getcomposer.org/) and an [Auth0 account](https://auth0.com/signup).

## Support Policy

The SDK follows the [Laravel support policy](https://laravel.com/docs/master/releases#support-policy) and will be supported until the Laravel version it supports reaches end-of-life, or it is no longer technically feasible to support.
