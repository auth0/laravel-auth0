This SDK helps you integrate your [Laravel](https://laravel.com/) application with [Auth0](https://auth0.com/) to achieve single sign-on with a few simple steps. The SDK also provides an easy method of integration all the functionality of the underlying [Auth0-PHP](https://github.com/auth0/auth-PHP) inside your Laravel application, including all types of authentication, authorization of API endpoints, and issuing Management API calls.

## Usage

### Getting Started

- Create a [free Auth0 account](https://auth0.com/signup) and register an [Application](https://auth0.com/docs/applications).
- If you do not already have one, [prepare a Laravel project](https://laravel.com/docs/master/installation).

### Installation

The supported method of SDK installation is through [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/). From your terminal shell, `cd` into your project directory and issue the following command:

```bash
composer require auth0/login:dev-main
```

### Configuration the SDK

Use the Laravel `vendor:publish` command to import the configuration file into your application:

```sh
php artisan vendor:publish --tag=auth0-config
```

Now edit your `.env` file and add Auth0 tenants details for your project, depending on the type of application you're building:

#### Regular Web Applications

```sh
# The URL of your Auth0 tenant domain
# You'll find this in your Auth0 Application's settings page.
AUTH0_DOMAIN=...

# Your Auth0 application's Client ID
# You'll find this in your Auth0 Application's settings page.
AUTH0_CLIENT_ID=...

# Your Auth0 application's Client ID
# You'll find this in your Auth0 Application's settings page.
AUTH0_CLIENT_SECRET=...

# Your Auth0 Custom API identifier/audience.
# You'll find this in your Custom API's settings page.
AUTH0_AUDIENCE=...

# Authentication callback URI, as defined in your Auth0 Application settings.
# (Update this as appropriate for your application's location.)
# (You must configure this in your Auth0 Application's settings page as well!)
AUTH0_REDIRECT_URI=http://localhost:3000/auth0/callback
```

#### Backend API Applications

These are applications that accept an Access Token through the 'Authorization' header of a request.

```sh
# This tells the Auth0 Laravel SDK about your use case to customize its behavior.
# The 'api' strategy is used for backend API applications like we're building here.
# See: https://github.com/auth0/auth0-PHP/blob/main/README.md#configuration-strategies
AUTH0_STRATEGY=api

# The URL of your Auth0 tenant domain
# You'll find this in your Auth0 Application's settings page.
AUTH0_DOMAIN=...

# Your Auth0 application's Client ID
# You'll find this in your Auth0 Application's settings page.
AUTH0_CLIENT_ID=...

# Your Auth0 Custom API identifier/audience.
# You'll find this in your Custom API's settings page.
AUTH0_AUDIENCE=...
```

#### Additional Options

The default configuration provided by the Auth0 Laravel SDK is intentionally limited and designed to support only the most common types of applications. More complex applications may require more robust configuration customizations available in the underlying Auth0-PHP SDK. You can add support for more configuration options by modifying your `config/auth0.php` and `.env` files. A complete list of configuration options are available [from the Auth0-PHP SDK README](https://github.com/auth0/auth0-PHP/blob/main/README.md#configuration-options).

### Configure your Application

Integrating the SDK's Guard requires some small changes to your `config\auth.php` file.

To begin, find the `defaults` section. Set the default `guard` to `auth0`, like this:

```php
// 📂 config/auth.php
'defaults' => [
    'guard' => 'auth0',
    // 📝 Leave any other settings in this section alone.
],
```

Next, find the `guards` section, and add `auth0` there:
```php
// 👆 Continued from above, in config/auth.php
'guards' => [
    // 📝 Any additional guards you use should stay here, too.
    'auth0' => [
        'driver' => 'auth0',
        'provider' => 'auth0',
    ],
],
```

Finally, find the `providers` section, and add `auth0` there as well:
```php
// 👆 Continued from above, in config/auth.php
'providers' => [
    // 📝 Any additional providers you use should stay here, too.
    'auth0' => [
        'driver' => 'auth0',
        'repository' => \Auth0\Laravel\Auth\User\Repository::class
    ],
],
```

### Authentication Routes

The SDK offers a number of convenience route controllers to ease supporting authentication in regular web application (that is, an application that handles end users logging in and out).

```php
Route::get('/login', \Auth0\Laravel\Http\Controller\Stateful\Login::class)->name('login');
Route::get('/logout', \Auth0\Laravel\Http\Controller\Stateful\Logout::class)->name('logout');
Route::get('/auth0/callback', \Auth0\Laravel\Http\Controller\Stateful\Callback::class)->name('auth0.callback');
```

These routes will automatically handle your regular web application's authentication flow for you.

### Protecting Routes with Middleware

The Auth0 Laravel SDK includes a number of middleware that simplify either authenticating (regular web applications) or authorizing (backend api applications) your Laravel routes, depending on the type of application you're building.

#### Regular Web Applications

These are for traditional applications that handle logging in and out.

The `auth0.authenticate` middleware will check for an available user session and redirect any requests without one to the login route:

```php
Route::get('/required', function () {
    return view('example.user.template');
})->middleware(['auth0.authenticate']);
```

The `auth0.authenticate.optional` middleware will check for an available user session, but won't reject or redirect requests without one, allowing you to treat such requests as "guest" requests:

```php
Route::get('/', function () {
    if (Auth::check()) {
        return view('example.user.template');
    }

    return view('example.guest.template');
})->middleware(['auth0.authenticate.optional']);
```

Note that the `example.user.template` and `example.guest.templates` views are just examples and are not part of the SDK; replace these as appropriate for your app.

#### Backend API Applications

These are applications that accept an Access Token through the 'Authorization' header of a request.

The `auth0.authorize` middleware will resolve a Access Token and reject any request with an invalid token.

```php
Route::get('/api/private', function () {
    return response()->json([
        'message' => 'Hello from a private endpoint! You need to be authenticated to see this.',
        'authorized' => Auth::check(),
        'user' => Auth::check() ? json_decode(json_encode((array) Auth::user(), JSON_THROW_ON_ERROR), true) : null,
    ], 200, [], JSON_PRETTY_PRINT);
})->middleware(['auth0.authorize']);
```

The `auth0.authorize` middleware also allows you to optionally filter requests for access tokens based on scopes:

```php
Route::get('/api/private-scoped', function () {
    return response()->json([
        'message' => 'Hello from a private endpoint! You need to be authenticated and have a scope of read:messages to see this.',
        'authorized' => Auth::check(),
        'user' => Auth::check() ? json_decode(json_encode((array) Auth::user(), JSON_THROW_ON_ERROR), true) : null,
    ], 200, [], JSON_PRETTY_PRINT);
})->middleware(['auth0.authorize:read:messages']);
```

The `auth0.authorize.optional` middleware will resolve an available Access Token, but won't block requests without one. This is useful when you want to treat tokenless requests as "guests":

```php
Route::get('/api/public', function () {
    return response()->json([
        'message' => 'Hello from a public endpoint! You don\'t need to be authenticated to see this.',
        'authorized' => Auth::check(),
        'user' => Auth::check() ? json_decode(json_encode((array) Auth::user(), JSON_THROW_ON_ERROR), true) : null,
    ], 200, [], JSON_PRETTY_PRINT);
})->middleware(['auth0.authorize.optional']);
```

## What is Auth0?

Auth0 helps you to:

- Add authentication with [multiple authentication sources](https://docs.auth0.com/identityproviders), either social like Google, Facebook, Microsoft, LinkedIn, GitHub, Twitter, Box, Salesforce (amongst others), or enterprise identity systems like Windows Azure AD, Google Apps, Active Directory, ADFS or any SAML Identity Provider.
- Add authentication through more traditional **[username/password databases](https://docs.auth0.com/mysql-connection-tutorial)**.
- Add support for [passwordless](https://auth0.com/passwordless) and [multi-factor authentication](https://auth0.com/docs/mfa).
- Add support for [linking different user accounts](https://docs.auth0.com/link-accounts) with the same user.
- Analytics of how, when, and where users are logging in.
- Pull data from other sources and add it to the user profile through [JavaScript rules](https://docs.auth0.com/rules).
