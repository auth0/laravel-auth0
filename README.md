You will also need [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) and an [Auth0 account](https://auth0.com/signup).

## Getting Started

The following is our recommended approach to getting started with the SDK. Alternatives are available in [our expanded installation guide](./docs/Installation.md).

### 1. Install the SDK

- For **new applications**, we offer a quickstart template â€” a version of the default Laravel 9 starter project pre-configured for use with the Auth0 SDK.

    ```shell
    composer create-project auth0-samples/laravel auth0-laravel-app && cd auth0-laravel-app
    ```

- For **existing applications**, you can install the SDK using Composer.

    ```shell
    composer require auth0/login:^7.9 --update-with-all-dependencies
    ```

    In this case, you will also need to generate an SDK configuration file for your application.

    ```shell
    php artisan vendor:publish --tag auth0
    ```

</details>

### 2. Install the CLI

1. Install the [Auth0 CLI](https://github.com/auth0/auth0-cli) to manage your account from the command line.

    ```shell
    curl -sSfL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/auth0/auth0-cli/main/install.sh | sh -s -- -b .
    ```

    Move the CLI to a directory in your `PATH` to make it available system-wide.

    ```shell
    sudo mv ./auth0 /usr/local/bin
    ```

    <p><small>ðŸ’¡ <em>If you prefer not to move the CLI, simply substitute `auth0` in the CLI steps below with `./auth0`.</small></em></p>

    <details>
    <summary>Using <a href="https://brew.sh/">Homebrew</a> (macOS)</summary>
    â€ƒ

    ```shell
    brew tap auth0/auth0-cli && brew install auth0
    ```

    </details>

    <details>
    <summary>Using <a href="https://scoop.sh/">Scoop</a> (Windows)</summary>
    â€ƒ

    ```cmd
    scoop bucket add auth0 https://github.com/auth0/scoop-auth0-cli.git
    scoop install auth0
    ```

    </details>

2. Authenticate the CLI with your Auth0 account. Choose "as a user" if prompted.

    ```shell
    auth0 login
    ```

### 3. Configure the SDK

1. Register a new application with Auth0.

    ```shell
    auth0 apps create \
      --name "My Laravel Application" \
      --type "regular" \
      --auth-method "post" \
      --callbacks "http://localhost:8000/callback" \
      --logout-urls "http://localhost:8000" \
      --reveal-secrets \
      --no-input \
      --json > .auth0.app.json
    ```

2. Register a new API with Auth0.

    ```shell
    auth0 apis create \
      --name "My Laravel Application API" \
      --identifier "https://github.com/auth0/laravel-auth0" \
      --offline-access \
      --no-input \
      --json > .auth0.api.json
    ```

3. Add the new files to `.gitignore`.

    ```bash
    echo ".auth0.*.json" >> .gitignore
    ```

    <details>
    <summary>Using Windows PowerShell</summary>
    â€ƒ

    ```powershell
    Add-Content .gitignore "`n.auth0.*.json"
    ```

    </details>

    <details>
    <summary>Using Windows Command Prompt</summary>
    â€ƒ

    ```cmd
    echo .auth0.*.json >> .gitignore
    ```

    </details>

### 4. Run the Application

Boot the application using PHP's built-in web server.

```shell
php artisan serve
```

Direct your browser to [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) to experiment with the application.

- **Authentication**  
  Users can log in or out of the application by visiting the [`/login`](http://localhost:8000/login) or [`/logout`](http://localhost:8000/logout) routes, respectively.

- **API Authorization**  
  For simplicity sake, generate a test token using the CLI.

    ```shell
    auth0 test token \
      --audience %IDENTIFIER% \
      --scopes "read:messages"
    ```

  <p><small>âœ‹ <em>Substitute <code>%IDENTIFIER%</code> with the identifier of the API you created in step 3 above.</small></em></p>

  Now you can send requests to the `/api` endpoints of the application, including the token as a header.

    ```shell
    curl --request GET \
      --url http://localhost:8000/api/example \
      --header 'Accept: application/json' \
      --header 'Authorization: Bearer %TOKEN%'
    ```

    <p><small>âœ‹ <em>Substitute <code>%TOKEN%</code> with the test token returned in the previous step.</small></em></p>

    <details>
    <summary>Using Windows PowerShell</summary>
    â€ƒ

    ```powershell
    Invoke-WebRequest http://localhost:8000/api/example `
      -Headers @{'Accept' = 'application/json'; 'Authorization' = 'Bearer %TOKEN%'}
    ```

    </details>

When you're ready to deploy your application to production, review [our deployment guide](./docs/Deployment.md) for best practices and advice on securing Laravel.

## Integration Examples

<details>
<summary><b>User Authentication</b></summary>
â€ƒ

The SDK automatically registers all the necessary routes and authentication services within the `web` middleware group of your application to enable users to authenticate without requiring you to write any code.

| Route       | Purpose                            |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------- |
| `/login`    | Initiates the authentication flow. |
| `/logout`   | Logs the user out.                 |
| `/callback` | Handles the callback from Auth0.   |

If these routes conflict with your application architecture, you can override this default behavior by [adjusting the SDK configuration](./docs/Configuration.md#route-registration).

---

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Route Authorization (Access Control)</b></summary>
â€ƒ

The SDK automatically registers its authentication and authorization guards within the `web` and `api` middleware groups for your Laravel application, respectively.

For `web` routes, you can use Laravel's `auth` middleware to require that a user be authenticated to access a route.

```php
Route::get('/private', function () {
  return response('Welcome! You are logged in.');
})->middleware('auth');
```

For `api` routes, you can use Laravel's `auth` middleware to require that a request be authenticated with a valid bearer token to access a route.

```php
Route::get('/api/private', function () {
  return response()->json(['message' => 'Hello! You included a valid token with your request.']);
})->middleware('auth');
```

In addition to requiring that a user be authenticated, you can also require that the user have specific permissions to access a route, using Laravel's `can` middleware.

```php
Route::get('/scope', function () {
    return response('You have the `read:messages` permission, and can therefore access this resource.');
})->middleware('auth')->can('read:messages');
```

Permissions require that [RBAC](https://auth0.com/docs/manage-users/access-control/rbac) be enabled within [your API settings](https://manage.auth0.com/#/apis).

---

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Users and Tokens</b></summary>
â€ƒ

Laravel's `Auth` Facade can be used to retrieve information about the authenticated user or token associated with a request.

For routes using the `web` middleware group in `routes/web.php`.

```php
Route::get('/', function () {
  if (! auth()->check()) {
    return response('You are not logged in.');
  }

  $user = auth()->user();
  $name = $user->name ?? 'User';
  $email = $user->email ?? '';

  return response("Hello {$name}! Your email address is {$email}.");
});
```

For routes using the `api` middleware group in `routes/api.php`.

```php
Route::get('/', function () {
  if (! auth()->check()) {
    return response()->json([
      'message' => 'You did not provide a token.',
    ]);
  }

  return response()->json([
    'message' => 'Your token is valid; you are authorized.',
    'id' => auth()->id(),
    'token' => auth()?->user()?->getAttributes(),
  ]);
});
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Management API Calls</b></summary>
â€ƒ

Once you've [authorized your application to make Management API calls](./docs/Management.md#api-application-authorization), you'll be able to engage nearly any of the [Auth0 Management API endpoints](https://auth0.com/docs/api/management/v2) through the SDK.

Each API endpoint has its own SDK class which can be accessed through the Facade's `management()` factory method. For interoperability, network responses from the API are returned as [PSR-7 messages](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-7/). These can be converted into native arrays using the SDK's `json()` method.

For example, to update a user's metadata, you can call the `management()->users()->update()` method.

```php
use Auth0\Laravel\Facade\Auth0;

Route::get('/colors', function () {
  $colors = ['red', 'blue', 'green', 'black', 'white', 'yellow', 'purple', 'orange', 'pink', 'brown'];

  // Update the authenticated user with a randomly assigned favorite color.
  Auth0::management()->users()->update(
    id: auth()->id(),
    body: [
      'user_metadata' => [
        'color' => $colors[random_int(0, count($colors) - 1)]
      ]
    ]
  );

  // Retrieve the user's updated profile.
  $profile = Auth0::management()->users()->get(auth()->id());

  // Convert the PSR-7 response into a native array.
  $profile = Auth0::json($profile);

  // Extract some values from the user's profile.
  $color = $profile['user_metadata']['color'] ?? 'unknown';
  $name = auth()->user()->name;

  return response("Hello {$name}! Your favorite color is {$color}.");
})->middleware('auth');
```

All the SDK's Management API methods are [documented here](./docs/Management.md).
