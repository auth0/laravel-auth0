# Laravel Auth0 Plugin
This plugin helps you integrate your Laravel WebApp with [Auth0](https://auth0.com/) to achieve Single Sign On with a few simple steps. You can see an example application [on the example directory](https://github.com/auth0/laravel-auth0/tree/master/examples/laravel-api).

## Installation

Check our docs page to get a complete guide on how to install it in an existing project or download a pre-configured seed project:

### Setting up a JWKs cache

In the `register` method of your `AppServiceProvider` add:

```php
  use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Cache;
  
  ...
    public function register()
    {
      ...

      $this->app->bind(
        '\Auth0\SDK\Helpers\Cache\CacheHandler',
        function() {
            static $cacheWrapper = null; 
            if ($cacheWrapper === null) {
                $cache = Cache::store();
                $cacheWrapper = new LaravelCacheWrapper($cache);
            }
            return $cacheWrapper;
        });

        ...
    }
```

You can implement your own cache strategy by creating a new class that implements the `Auth0\SDK\Helpers\Cache\CacheHandler` contract, or just use the cache strategy you want by picking that store with `Cache::store('your_store_name')`;

### Storing users in your database

You can customize the way you handle the users in your application by creating your own `UserRepository`. This class should implement the `Auth0\Login\Contract\Auth0UserRepository` contract.

```php
<?php 
namespace App\Repository;

use Auth0\Login\Contract\Auth0UserRepository;

class MyCustomUserRepository implements Auth0UserRepository {

    /* This class is used on api authN to fetch the user based on the jwt.*/
    public function getUserByDecodedJWT($jwt) {
      return $this->upsertUser($jwt);
    }

    public function getUserByUserInfo($userInfo) {
      return $this->upsertUser($userInfo['profile']);
    }

    protected function upsertUser($profile) {

      $user = User::where("auth0id", $profile->sub)->first();

      if ($user === null) {
          // If not, create one
          $user = new User();
          $user->email = $profile->email; // you should ask for the email scope
          $user->auth0id = $profile->sub;
          $user->name = $profile->name; // you should ask for the name scope
          $user->save();
      }

      return $user;
    }

    public function getUserByIdentifier($identifier) {
        //Get the user info of the user logged in (probably in session)
        $user = \App::make('auth0')->getUser();

        if ($user===null) return null;

        // build the user
        $user = $this->getUserByUserInfo($user);

        // it is not the same user as logged in, it is not valid
        if ($user && $user->auth0id == $identifier) {
            return $auth0User;
        }
    }

}
```

###Laravel 5.2

####Routes
Your routes need to be in the `web` routes group, otherwise it will not be able to use the session storage:

```
Route::group(['middleware' => ['web']], function () {

  Route::get('/auth0/callback', '\Auth0\Login\Auth0Controller@callback');

  Route::get('/', function () {

    if (Auth::check()) dd('LOGGED IN',Auth::user());

    return view('welcome');

  });
});
```

####Auth setup

In your `config/auth.php` file update the providers to use the `auth0` driver:

```
...
    'providers' => [
        'users' => [
            'driver' => 'auth0',
        ],
    ],
...
```

##Laravel Compatibility

If you are working with an older version (Laravel 4.x) you need to point to composer.json to the version 1.0.*
