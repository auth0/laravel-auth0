# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

-   Relaxed response types from middleware to use low-level `Symfony\Component\HttpFoundation\Response` class, allowing for broader and custom response types.

## [7.5.1](https://github.com/auth0/laravel-auth0/tree/7.5.1) (2023-04-04)

**Fixed**

-   Resolved an issue wherein custom user repositories could fail to be instantiated under certain circumstances.

## [7.5.0](https://github.com/auth0/laravel-auth0/tree/7.5.0) (2023-04-03)

This release includes support for Laravel 10, and major improvements to the internal state handling mechanisms of the SDK.

**Added**

-   Support for Laravel 10 [#349](https://github.com/auth0/laravel-auth0/pull/349)
-   New `Auth0\Laravel\Traits\Imposter` trait to allow for easier testing. [Example usage](./tests/Unit/Traits/ImpersonateTest.php)
-   New Exception types have been added for more precise error catching.

**Changed**
The following changes have no effect on the external API of this package, but may affect internal usage.

-   `Guard` will now more reliably detect changes in the underlying Auth0-PHP SDK session state.
-   `Guard` will now more reliably sync changes back to the underlying Auth0-PHP SDK session state.
-   `StateInstance` concept has been replaced by new `Credentials` entity.
-   `Guard` updated to use new `Credentials` entity as primary internal storage for user data.
-   `Auth0\Laravel\Traits\ActingAsAuth0User` was updated to use new`Credentials` entity.
-   The HTTP middleware have been refactored to more clearly differentiate between token and session based identities.
-   The `authenticate`, `authenticate.optional` and `authorize.optional` HTTP middleware now support scope filtering, as `authorize` already did.

**Fixed**

-   A 'Session store not set on request' error could occur when downstream applications implemented unit testing that use the Guard. This should be resolved now.
-   `Guard` would not always honor the `provider` configuration value in `config/auth.php`.
-   `Guard` is no longer defined as a Singleton to better support applications that need multi-guard configurations.

**Maintenance**

-   Upgraded test suite to use PEST 2.0 framework.
-   Updated test coverage to 100%.

**Important Notes**

**1. Changes to `user()` behavior**
This release includes a significant behavior change around the `user()` method of the Guard. Previously, by simply invoking the method, the SDK would search for any available credential (access token, device session, etc.) and automatically assign the user within the Guard. The HTTP middleware have been upgraded to handle the user assignment step, and `user()` now only returns the current state of user assignment without altering it.

A new property has been added to the `config/auth0.php` configuration file: `behavior`. This is an array. At this time, there is a single option: `legacyGuardUserMethod`, a bool. If this value is set to true, or if the key is missing, the previously expected behavior will be applied, and `user()` will behave as it did before this release. The property defaults to `false`.

**2. Changes to Guard and Provider driver aliases**
We identified an issue with using identical alias naming for both the Guard and Provider singletons under Laravel 10, which has required us to rename these aliases. As previous guidance had been to instantiate these using their class names, this should not be a breaking change in most cases. However, if you had used `auth0` as the name for either the Guard or the Provider drivers, kindly note that these have changed. Please use `auth0.guard` for the Guard driver, and `auth0.provider` for the Provider driver. This is a regrettable change, but was necessary for adequate Laravel 10 support.

Thank you to [tonyfox-disguise](https://github.com/tonyfox-disguise), [jeovajr](https://github.com/jeovajr) and [nie7321](https://github.com/nie7321) for their contributions to this release.

**Changed**

-   `Auth0\Laravel\Store\LaravelSession` has been added as the default `sessionStorage` and `transientStorage` interfaces for the underlying [Auth0-PHP SDK](https://github.com/auth0/auth0-PHP/). The SDK now leverages the native [Laravel Session APIs](https://laravel.com/docs/9.x/session) by default. [\#307](https://github.com/auth0/laravel-auth0/pull/307) ([evansims](https://github.com/evansims))ยน
-   `Auth0\Laravel\Cache\LaravelCachePool` and `Auth0\Laravel\Cache\LaravelCacheItem` have been added as the default `tokenCache` and `managementTokenCache` interfaces for the underlying [Auth0-PHP SDK](https://github.com/auth0/auth0-PHP/). The SDK now leverages the native [Laravel Cache APIs](https://laravel.com/docs/9.x/cache) by default. [\#307](https://github.com/auth0/laravel-auth0/pull/307) ([evansims](https://github.com/evansims))
-   `Auth0\Laravel\Auth\Guard` now supports the `viaRemember` method. [\#306](https://github.com/auth0/laravel-auth0/pull/306) ([tonyfox-disguise](https://github.com/tonyfox-disguise))
-   `Auth0\Laravel\Http\Middleware\Stateless\Authorize` now returns a 401 status instead of 403 for unauthenticated users. [\#304](https://github.com/auth0/laravel-auth0/issues/304) ([jeovajr](https://github.com/jeovajr))
-   PHP 8.0 is now the minimum supported runtime version. Please review the [README](README.md) for more information on support windows.

ยน This change may require your application's users to re-authenticate. You can avoid this by changing the `sessionStorage` and `transientStorage` options in your SDK configuration to their previous default instances of `Auth0\SDK\Store\CookieStore`, but it is recommended you migrate to the new `LaravelSession` default.
